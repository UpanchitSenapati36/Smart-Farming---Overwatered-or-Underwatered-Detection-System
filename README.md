# Smart Farming Overwatered or Underwatered Detection System ðŸŒ¾ðŸ’§

The **Smart Farming Overwatered or Underwatered Detection System** leverages **TensorFlow, Python, CNN, and ResNet50** to monitor rice plant health and detect whether plants are overwatered or underwatered.
Developed on **Google Colab**, the project features a custom **HydroNet model** that analyzes real-time plant data to provide accurate irrigation recommendations.
By offering optimized watering schedules based on plant health, the system helps **enhance crop yield** and **conserve water resources**, demonstrating the power of **machine learning in precision agriculture**.

## Features
